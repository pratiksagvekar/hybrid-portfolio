# Hybrid Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio — a reflection of how I work across **media, event operations, and technology**.

Rather than fitting into a single role, this portfolio represents a hybrid skill set built from real on-ground experience and growing technical capability.

## Why this portfolio exists

I’ve worked across:
- **Media & content** — event coverage, communication, storytelling
- **Event operations** — on-ground coordination, execution, high-pressure environments
- **Technology & AI tools** — building systems to improve workflows and reduce chaos

This portfolio brings those experiences together and explores how **real-world coordination problems** in student, community, and event ecosystems can be solved through better systems.

## What’s inside

- A resume-style portfolio layout
- Clear representation of experience across domains
- Focus on usability, clarity, and real-world relevance
- Built with clean **HTML & CSS** (no heavy frameworks)

---

## Status

This is a **living portfolio**.  
It will evolve as I build more tools, systems, and projects at the intersection of events, media, and tech.
